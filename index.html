        <h4>A tool for city-seekers to choose their next destination that overlaps the best with their weather preference!</h4>
        <p>By Lucas Wang for INFO 474, Spring 2023</p>
        <p class="note">Please see the last section, "Explanation and Disclaimers," at the bottom of this page for the complete explanation, disclaime, citations, and notes on the dataset used for this tool.</p>
        <p class="note">All temperature values used in this tool uses the imperial Fahrenheit unit (degrees F).</p>

        <h2>Initial Scoping</h2>
        <p>
            Initial scoping is intended to narrow down your options to just a few cities for detailed analysis. Please enter your preferred
            average temperature range below to get some recommendations!
        </p>
        <p>
            Weather-or-Not checks your minimum and maximum comfortable temperatures against the average daily minimum
            and maximum temperature of every city since 1880, and only returns the cities that fall within your comfortable
            temperature range.

            For the cities shown below, we recommend diving deeper with the "Precise City-Specific Comparison" tool for further analysis!

        <h2>Precise City-Specific Comparison</h2>
        <p>
            Precise City-Specific Comparison is intended to give you a precise breakdown of how a specific
            city fits into your range of comfortable temperatures by giving you a "three times a month" breakdown of
            from July 2014 to June 2015, showing how many days in each week has an actual measured maximum
            temperature is higher than your preference, and how many days an actual measured minimum
            temperature is lower than your preference.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each month is broken into three uniform sections of 10 days. While this does not technically take into
            account leap years and the different total length of months, it is intended to show a rough breakdown of
            each month.

            The this visualizations, we hope to make it easier for you to precisely plan out
            what clothing, tools, equipment, etc. to prepare for any specific time of the year in that city!

        <h2>Data Explanation, Disclaimer, and Citations</h2>
        <p>
            The data were obtained directly from the INFO 474 teaching staff/materials.
        </p>
        <p>
            Detailed citations have been omitted from the sections above with the intention of simplifying the
            user experience of the previous sections: to help the user with an intuitive, quick decision based on
            the results provided from the visualization.
        </p>
        <p>
            Certain portions of the dataset were omitted entirely from this analysis:
        </p>
        <p>
            The "actual mean temperature" of a particular days between July 2014 and June 2015 was omitted as it
            did not play enough of a role in the intended purpose of Weather-Or-Not since the goal is to surface
            highs and lows in temperature of each day.
        </p>
        <p>
            Any data concerning record temperatures were omitted, since they do not represent a practical and realistic
            piece of data in establishing what to generally expect in the city: a heatstorm or blizzard won't help much in establishing
            the general trend of the city.
        </p>
        <p>
            Any data concerning precipitation were removed, since 1) they do not relate to the tool's theme of focusing only
            on temperature, and 2) I believe that precipitation is tricky to show intuitively without other methods of
            visualization: what does 5 millimeters of precipitation even refer to? How deep is it? I believe that
            some sort of depth-oriented visualization method would be the best option for precipitation, perhaps
            augmented reality?
        </p>
        <h2>Future Development</h2>
        <p>
            Several ideas for the future development of Weather-Or-Not surfaced from the development fo this prototype:
        </p>
        <p>Support for both Celsius and Fahrenheit.</p>
        <p>Support for zoom/change of scale (monthly, weekly, seasonal, etc.).</p>
